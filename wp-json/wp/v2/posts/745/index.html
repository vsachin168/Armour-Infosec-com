Its primary purpose is to detect weak Unix passwords. Besides several crypt(3) password hash types most commonly found on various Unix systems, supported out of the box are Windows LM hashes, plus lots of other hashes and ciphers in the community-enhanced version. John the Ripper homepage.<!--more--><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>THC Hydra<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When you need to brute force crack a remote authentication service, Hydra is often the tool of choice. It can perform rapid dictionary attacks against more than 50 protocols, including telnet, ftp, http, https, smb, several databases, and much more.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>\u00a0Hping<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">hping is a command-line oriented TCP\/IP packet assembler\/analyzer. The interface is inspired to the ping(8) unix command, but hping isn&#8217;t only able to send ICMP echo requests. It supports TCP, UDP, ICMP and RAW-IP protocols, has a traceroute mode, the ability to send files between a covered channel, and many other features.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>\u00a0Nmap<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Nmap (&#8220;Network Mapper&#8221;) is a free and open source utility for network discovery and security auditing. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what hosts are available on the network, what services (application name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems (and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet filters\/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Ncat<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ncat is a feature-packed networking utility which reads and writes data across networks from the command line. Ncat was written for the Nmap Project and is the culmination of the currently splintered family of Netcat incarnations. It is designed to be a reliable back-end tool to instantly provide network connectivity to other applications and users. Ncat will not only work with IPv4 and IPv6 but provides the user with a virtually limitless number of potential uses.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Wireshark<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Wireshark is the world&#8217;s foremost network protocol analyzer. It lets you see what&#8217;s happening on your network at a microscopic level. It is the de facto (and often de jure) standard across many industries and educational institutions.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>ettercap<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ettercap is a comprehensive suite for man in the middle attacks. It features sniffing of live connections, content filtering on the fly and many other interesting tricks. It supports active and passive dissection of many protocols and includes many features for network and host analysis.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Nikto2<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Nikto is an Open Source (GPL) web server scanner which performs comprehensive tests against web servers for multiple items, including over 6700 potentially dangerous files\/programs, checks for outdated versions of over 1250 servers, and version specific problems on over 270 servers. It also checks for server configuration items such as the presence of multiple index files, HTTP server options, and will attempt to identify installed web servers and software. Scan items and plugins are frequently updated and can be automatically updated.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Kismet<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Kismet is an 802.11 layer2 wireless network detector, sniffer, and intrusion detection system. Kismet will work with any wireless card which supports raw monitoring (rfmon) mode, and (with appropriate hardware) can sniff 802.11b, 802.11a, 802.11g, and 802.11n traffic. Kismet also supports plugins which allow sniffing other media such as DECT.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>w3af<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">w3af is a <strong>Web Application Attack and Audit Framework<\/strong>. The project\u2019s goal is to create a framework to help you secure your web applications by finding and exploiting all web application vulnerabilities.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Burp Suite<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Burp Suite is an integrated platform for performing security testing of web applications. Its various tools work seamlessly together to support the entire testing process, from initial mapping and analysis of an application&#8217;s attack surface, through to finding and exploiting security vulnerabilities.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Sqlmap<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">sqlmap is an open source penetration testing tool that automates the process of detecting and exploiting SQL injection flaws and taking over of database servers. It comes with a powerful detection engine, many niche features for the ultimate penetration tester and a broad range of switches lasting from database fingerprinting, over data fetching from the database, to accessing the underlying file system and executing commands on the operating system via out-of-band connections.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>WebScarab<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">WebScarab is a framework for analysing applications that communicate using the HTTP and HTTPS protocols. It is written in Java, and is thus portable to many platforms. WebScarab has several modes of operation, implemented by a number of plugins. In its most common usage, WebScarab operates as an intercepting proxy, allowing the operator to review and modify requests created by the browser before they are sent to the server, and to review and modify responses returned from the server before they are received by the browser. WebScarab is able to intercept both HTTP and HTTPS communication. The operator can also review the conversations (requests and responses) that have passed through WebScarab.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Metasploit<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Metasploit simplifies network discovery and vulnerability verification for specific exploits, increasing the effectiveness of vulnerability scanners. This helps prioritize remediation and eliminate false positives, providing true security risk intelligence.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>John the Ripper John the Ripper is a fast password cracker, currently available for many flavors of Unix, Windows, DOS,&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":801,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[6],"tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v21.0 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Best free hacking tools | Top free hacking tools<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Hacking always involves tools.
